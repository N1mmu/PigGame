# Description
Its a fun little 2 player game where u have to score 100 points to win.

Game rules:
1) it starts with player1's turn to roll the dice
2) if u get a 1 when u roll the dice then ur turn ends and u lose ur points
3)When u click hold , the points u gathered by rolling dice will be added to your score
4) the first one to reach 100 wins the game :)

I created this project with the help of an udemy course by Jonas Schmedtmann
